<h3>Heaven on their minds</h3>
<p>my mind is clearer now.  at last, all too well, i can see where we all soon will be.</p>
<p>if you strip away the myth, from the man, you will see where we all soon will be</p>
<p><h4>jesus</h4></p><p> you've started to believe the things they say of you.  you really do believe this talk of god is true</p>
<p>and all the good you've done will soon get swept away. you've begun to matter more than the things you say</p>
<p>this is my blood you drink.
this is my body you eat.
if you would remember me, when you eat and drink.</p>
